- Scheduling the appointments
- Updating appointments based on patients being admitted
- Discharging patients


## Steps to Follow

2. You have to work directly in this GitHub repository. It is like your own copy of the original repository.

3. The folder structure is as given below:
   ```
   src
   ├── Patient.java
   ├── Clinic.java
   └── ClinicManagementSystem.java
   ```

4. Review the code/comments present in above files to understand the structure.
5. Implement the missing methods marked with **TODO** comments.
6. To work on the files, you can clone this GitHub repository onto your system and then open it with an IDE like IntelliJ, or Eclipse.
7. Once done, push your changes to this remote GitHub repository.
